      #### **Overview**

      It's a stylized 6-minute animation.

      Created with Maya + RenderMan mainly. All visuals crafted independently; music composed collaboratively.

      Watch it on [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/9jc6oblx0aY) or [**Vimeo**](https://vimeo.com/1137545512).

      #### **Concept & Storyboard**

      The project originated from a simple question: how does an unlikely creature pursue flight?

      I built the narrative around an ant—an improbable flyer—then developed the full ecosystem around it: blue-tree forests, walnut-house interiors, and daily-life vignettes that support the emotional arc.

      Character, Storyboard, Environment.

      #### **3D Modelling & Rigging**

      Asset creation (characters, props, sets, etc) was executed end-to-end.
      Rigging is my core competency, so character and prop rigs were designed for reliability, deformation quality, and animation efficiency. Textures were hand-painted and stylized, inspired by Arcane.

      Modelling, Riggging, Textures.

      #### **Animation & Compositing**

      Animation followed a disciplined production workflow: Layout, Blocking, Polish.

      Simulation and FX elements were layered on top.

      All shots were finalized in Nuke, where lighting, and compositing pulled the look together.

      Animation, Simulation, Compositing.

      #### **Overview**

      This desktop pet is fully Python-based with no external game engine.

      Source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/miliuumeru/ml_desktop_pet)
      

      #### **Pet Behaviours**

      I designed and painted pixel animations: idle loops, interaction poses, expressions, and a set of behaviour variants.

      To keep the pet believable, behaviours are state-driven and context-aware.

      For example:

      When the pet is focused on a task, interrupting it with food triggers annoyance.

      Idle behaviours branch into multiple variants for natural randomness.

      Hover, click, meal-time, and birthday states all drive specific reactions.


      ![](images/Pet.gif)


      #### **Core System & Animation State Machine**

      Under the hood, the desktop pet runs on a custom framework that I engineered end-to-end:

      Dedicated UI system (PyQt).

      Configurable behaviour system for sleep time, meal schedules, and birthday greetings.
      
      State machine architecture coordinating hover, click, idle, sleep, and interaction logic.

      ![](images/Hair_Poster.jpg)

      #### **Overview**

      A Python-driven Kinematic hair-binding tool for Maya, designed to accelerate character production and remove repetitive manual setup.
      It converts polygonal hair meshes into animation-ready joint chains with physics support, enabling fast iteration and predictable deformation.
      
      Source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/miliuumeru/ml_hair_rigging)

      #### **Workflow and main code**

      The result is a production-ready solution that dramatically shortens rigging turnaround time while maintaining clean rig structure for animators.

      The workflow moves through four core stages:

      Curve Extraction – Convert the hair mesh into guide curves, aligned along the mesh’s central axis rather than surface flow.
      
      Curve Rebuild & Joint Generation – Rebuild clean curve topology and procedurally generate joints along each strand.
      
      Kinematic Hair Physics System – Build a lightweight physics hierarchy to drive secondary motion.
      
      Mesh Skinning – Bind the hair meshes to their joint chains through a streamlined batch-skinning routine.

      #### **Overview**

      This project explores a biopunk world-building concept set in a fantastical post-apocalyptic landscape. 
      In this universe, creatures survive by scavenging industrial remnants scattered across a ruined world and grafting them onto their own bodies. 
      Over generations, this behavior drives species-wide mutation and gives rise to hybrid biomechanical organisms.

      #### **Map concept**

      This world sits in a post-industrial contamination era.
      However, the pollution has been contained within a central floating island, restrained by a colossal ancient tree. 
      Only three traversal routes connect the island to the surrounding continental plates.


      ![](images/Biopunk_3.jpg)


      #### **Creature Concept(2D)**

      These organisms are not natural species, they are biomechanics.
      Primitive biological forms scavenge mechanical debris, fuse it into their bodies, and undergo mutation driven by toxic residue and incompatible components.

      
      ![](images/Biopunk_2.jpg)


      #### **Creature Concept(3D)**

      The designs are further developed with ZBrush sculpting, rendering, and digital paint-over to explore material blending and functional detail.

      #### **Overview**

      This character is inspired by a book called Shui Hu Zhuan (Water Margin).
      The project covers a full end-to-end production pipeline: modeling, rendering, 3D printing, surface prep, and hand-painting.

      The goal was to translate a traditional character into a stylized digital sculpt and a physical collectible while preserving character personality and historical aesthetics.
