      ![](images/SEED_Poster.jpg)

      #### **Overview**

      It's a stylized 6-minute animation. Created with Maya + RenderMan mainly. All visuals crafted independently; music composed collaboratively.

      Watch it on [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/9jc6oblx0aY) or [**Vimeo**](https://vimeo.com/1137545512).

      #### **Concept & Storyboard**

      The project started from a simple question: how does an unlikely creature want to fly?

      I built the narrative around an ant, then developed the full ecosystem: blue-tree forests, walnut-house interiors, and daily-life vignettes that support the emotional arc.

      ![](images/SEED_6.jpg)


      #### **3D Modelling & Rigging**

      Asset creation (characters, props, sets, etc) was done in Maya. Character and prop rigs were designed for deformation quality, and animation efficiency. Textures were hand-painted and stylized, inspired by Arcane.

      #### **Animation & Compositing**

      Animation workflow: layout, blocking, polish. Then the simulation and 2D FX elements. All shots were finalized in Nuke, where lighting, and compositing pulled the look together.

      #### **Overview**

      This desktop pet is fully Python-based with no external game engine.

      Source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/miliuumeru/ml_desktop_pet)
      

      #### **Pet Behaviours**

      I designed and painted pixel animations: idle loops, interactions, expressions, and behaviour variants. To keep the pet believable, behaviours are state-driven and context-aware.

      For example:

      When the pet is focused on a task, interrupting it with food triggers annoyance.

      Idle behaviours branch into multiple variants for natural randomness.

      Hover, click, meal-time, and birthday states all drive specific reactions.


      ![](images/Pet.gif)


      #### **Core System & Animation State Machine**

      The desktop pet runs on a custom framework that I engineered end-to-end in Python: configurable behaviour system, animation state machine and UI system (PyQt).

      #### **Overview**

      A Python-driven kinematic hair-binding tool for Maya, designed to accelerate character production and remove repetitive manual setup.
      
      Source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/miliuumeru/ml_hair_rigging)

      #### **Workflow and main code**

      Core stages:

      Curve Extraction – Convert the hair mesh into guide curves, aligned along the mesh’s central axis rather than surface flow.
      
      Curve Rebuild & Joint Generation – Rebuild clean curve topology and procedurally generate joints along each strand.
      
      Kinematic Hair Physics System – Build a lightweight physics hierarchy to drive secondary motion.
      
      Mesh Skinning – Bind the hair meshes to their joint chains through a streamlined batch-skinning routine.

      #### **Overview**

      This project explores a biopunk world-building concept set in a fantastical post-apocalyptic landscape.

      In this universe, creatures survive by scavenging industrial remnants scattered across a ruined world and grafting them onto their own bodies. Over generations, this behavior drives species-wide mutation and gives rise to hybrid biomechanical organisms.

      Aili and Devin are police partners and ... soulmates.

      Aili is impulsive and high-strung, acting before she thinks and showing no emotion.

      Devin, a bird-folk boy who wears every feeling on his face, constantly worries about her.

      #### **Overview**

      Doom is a demon that exists beyond human awareness. It appears only when people let their guard down, slipping in to steal their clarity of mind.

      For those it captures, Doom forcibly pries open their consciousness—not harming their physical body, but stoling their sanity. After losing sense of reason, victims often make foolish choices they later regret.

      #### **Overview**

      This character is inspired by a book called Shui Hu Zhuan (Water Margin).
      The project covers a full end-to-end production pipeline: modeling, rendering, 3D printing, surface prep, and hand-painting.

      The goal was to translate a traditional character into a stylized digital sculpt and a physical collectible while preserving character personality and historical aesthetics.
